# InterfaceMocker
InterfaceMocker is a lightweight TypeScript library that simplifies the creation of mock objects for interfaces. It automates the process of generating mocks, allowing developers to easily simulate the behavior of any TypeScript interface. This is especially useful in unit testing, where mocking dependencies is key to isolating components and testing them effectively. With InterfaceMocker, you can customize the behavior of mock methods, reduce boilerplate code, and ensure cleaner, more maintainable test code. The library integrates seamlessly with existing TypeScript projects, making it a powerful tool for test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD).
